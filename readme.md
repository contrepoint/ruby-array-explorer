# [Ruby Array Explorer](https://contrepoint.github.io/ruby-array-explorer/)
* Ruby is my first programming language. When learning it, I spent a lot of time looking up documentation and googling. I was inspired by Sarah Drasner's [Javascript Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer) and ported it to Ruby.
* To quote Sarah, "please keep in mind that this is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for full documentation". Each method also links to the Ruby docs.
* I based the examples and longer descriptions off the Ruby docs, altering as needed to make it more beginner-friendly.

## Notes:
  * Ruby commands always return something.
  * At the prompt of [irb](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html), a Ruby shell, typing in `nums = [4, 5, 6]` and pressing enter results in `=> [4, 5, 6]`.
  * Similarly, the code in [Ruby Array Explorer]((https://contrepoint.github.io/ruby-array-explorer/) shows you what is returned at the end of every command.
  * Thus, `nums = [4, 5, 6] #=> [4, 5, 6]` means that `nums = [4, 5, 6]` returns `[4, 5, 6]`
  * Syntax highlighted with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
